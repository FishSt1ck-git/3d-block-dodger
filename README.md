# Game #1 - 3d Block Dodger

This is my first try at some video game development in Unity.
I followed the Brackeys - How to make a videogame tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik)

The game itself is a simple block dodging game to test out the basics in Unity.

Functionality
-----------------------------
- Travel as far as you can along the floating floor while dodging grey blocks
- Control the red block with arrowkeys, WASD, controller dpad, controller analogue
- Score measurement for distance traveled with persistant highscore
- Grey blocks appear from the fog
- "Game Over" condition for collision or falling

Possible future tweaks
-----------------------------
- Adjust forward/sideways offset to feel better
- Make the level design more interesting or challenging
- Add a time aspect to the score to challenge the player to go fast
- Start with a screen to fill in a player name
- Show a highscore top 10
- Sync highscores online
