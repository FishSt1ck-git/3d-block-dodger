# Game #1 - 3d Block Dodger

This is my first try at some video game development in Unity. Although I've been a C# dev for quite some time, I was surprised to see that the development just seems like a minor part. There's so much things that I don't know yet, so a lot of things to learn.

To start getting familiar with Unity, I followed a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik) by the great Brackeys. I didn't know who that was until I decided to do something with Unity. It became clear very fast that this man is a legend in the community. 

What I learned from this
-----------------------------
- The Unity UI basics
- How scripts are called and work
- Input handling (although I used the newer system instead of the one used in the tutorial)
- Basic object manipulation
- Boxcolliders and collisions handling
- Adding UI components

The game
-----------------------------
It's a simple block dodging game to test out the basics in Unity.
