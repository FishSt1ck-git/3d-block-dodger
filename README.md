# Game #1 - 3d Block Dodger

This is my first try at some video game development in Unity.
I followed the Brackeys - How to make a videogame tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik)

What I learned from this
-----------------------------
- The Unity UI
- How scripts are called and work
- Input handling (although I used the newer system instead of the one used here)
- Basic object manipulation
- Adding UI components
- Boxcolliders and collisions handling

The game
-----------------------------
It's a simple block dodging game to test out the basics in Unity.
