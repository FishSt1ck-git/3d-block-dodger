# Game #1 - 3d Block Dodger

This is my first try at some video game development in Unity.
I followed the Brackeys - How to make a videogame tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik)

The game itself is a simple block dodging game to test out the basics in Unity.

It consists of the following functionality:
- Game input through arrowkeys, WASD, controller dpad, controller analogue
- Score measurement for distance traveled
- Persistant highscore
- "Game Over" condition for collision or falling

Tweaks that might have improved it:
- Adjust forward/sideways offset to feel better
- Make the level design more interesting or challenging
- Add a time aspect to the score to challenge the player to go fast
